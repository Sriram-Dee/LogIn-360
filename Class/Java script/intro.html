        JavaScript variable is simply the name of a storage location.
            There are two types of variables:
                => Local variable (we can use it only within the function where we assigned that variable)

                    function example {
                        var x = 5; // local variable
                    }

                => global variable (we can use it where evere we want )

        */

                document.writeln("Today's apple rate is Rs: " + apple + "<br>" )
                console.log("Today's apple rate is Rs: " + apple)

       /* 
        Rules while declaring variable
            => Name must be start with letter.
            => after letters we can use numbers (0-9).
            => JS variables are case sensitive for examble x & X are different variable.
