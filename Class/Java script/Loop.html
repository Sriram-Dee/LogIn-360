        // Conditional statement


/*Syntax 
         if(condition){
             statement      // if the condition is true i'll process this statement
         }
         else{
             statement      // otherwise it'll process this
         }


    we can add more conditions by using else if:

         if(condition){
             statement
         }
         else if{
             statement   
         }

         else{
             statement
         }

         let age = 18;

         if( age >= 18){
            console.log("You are eligible for voting")
         }
         else{
            console.log("Sorry, you are minor")
         }

         let rate = 150;

         if (rate>150){
            console.log("Price is too highy, Wait for the Price drop")
         }
         else if(rate>=140){
            console.log("Price is okay, You can buy if you want")
         }
         else{
            console.log("Sure, Buy it right now!")
         }

//-----------------Switch statement:

/*
         switch(expression){
            case x:
                //code block;
                break;
            case y:
                //code block;
                break;
         }

         This is how it works:
            => Switch statement to select on of many code block tobe excecuted.
            => The switch expression is evaluated once.
            => The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
            => If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
            => If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

        The break Keyword
           => When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
           => This will stop the execution inside the switch block.
           => It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.
        
        The default Keyword
           =>The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:
