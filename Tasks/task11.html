        <h1>Itachi Uchiha</h1>
        <p>When Itachi Uchiha is first mentioned by Sasuke Uchiha in the manga, Masashi Kishimoto had not planned out the character's backstory. His only idea he had was to attribute to Itachi some violent action that would have Sasuke wanting to kill him. However, when Itachi was introduced, Kishimoto had the idea to make Itachi Konoha's secret agent who killed his clan under their orders.[12] Itachi was originally conceived as the leader of Konoha's Special Assassination and Tactical Squad called the "Anbu", dubbed the Itachi Squad (イタチ隊, Itachi-tai), which would have been a 70-man group divided into four teams, specializing in assassination and other illicit operations. However, this idea was scrapped in favour of the current Itachi working for the Akatsuki.[13] From all the Akatsuki characters Kishimoto designed, Itachi is his favorite based on his backstory.</p>

        <h1>Jiraiya</h1>
        <p>Manga author Masashi Kishimoto first conceived Jiraiya's name based on Kabuki. He conceptualized him as a wizard with frog-like traits. He gave him an incisive and energetic speech pattern specific to old Kabuki plays. Kishimoto stated that Jiraiya "makes everything more colorful" since he is one of the few characters who enjoy talking.[1] Regarding the bonds in the story, Kishimoto highlighted the importance of the character's death during his fight against Pain; this remark was made since, in his last moments, Jiraiya manages to discover the origin of Pain's multiple bodies and uses his last forces to send a message to Naruto Uzumaki in which he explains how Pain can be defeated. Kishimoto felt he had done a good job of establishing Jiraiya's last moments</p>
        <p> He commented that out of all the master-pupil relationships he had created in the Naruto series, the bond between Naruto and Jiraiya is his favorite, stating that drawing their interactions was "worthwhile". Jiraiya was one of the characters that resonated the most with the author alongside Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha, and Haku.
            At the 2015 New York Comic-Con, when asked which character besides Naruto is his favorite, Kishimoto chose Jiraiya. Due to the fans' preference, Kishimoto drew a sketch of Jiraiya in front of the audience at the event. He stated he felt nostalgic since this was the first time he had drawn Jiraiya or any other character in the series for a while. </p>

        <h1>Kakashi Hatake</h1>
        <p>Kakashi is depicted in Naruto as an eccentric but highly skilled shinobi for the Hidden Leaf Village. Initially cold and calculated due to the suicide of his father, Sakumo, Kakashi eventually began to warm up in his youth with the help of his teammate Obito Uchiha, while they are under the tutelage of Naruto's father Minato Namikaze. It is through Obito that Kakashi obtains the Uchiha clan's Sharingan, which he uses to copy the abilities of his opponents and make his own, but also drains his energy. Following the deaths of all of his squadmates, unaware of Obito's survival, Kakashi is eventually given charge of Team 7 due to his connections with Minato and the Uchiha, and through them is able to finally have the family he never had. He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends, students, and the village becomes increasingly apparent.</p>
        <p>Kakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. </p>

    <div>
        <h1>Madara Uchiha</h1>
        <p>Madara is not just like any other character introduced in the series. He created Madara as a character with no weaknesses.[4] As one of the antagonists in the story, Kishimoto designed Madara as the antithesis to the protagonists' values, a perfect anti-hero.[6] Kishimoto also said Naruto always defeated his enemies without intending to kill them by settling disputes with words since his battle with Nagato. Naruto truly forgave his enemy instead of having kill them, a concept Kishimoto liked but which no other shonen manga truly followed.[2] Kishimoto found the idea of the two characters interacting and settling their differences more interesting and challenging, rather than killing them. So from the Nagato battle onwards, he decided to introduce the resurrected Madara to have someone to beat. According to Kishimoto, this was one of the reasons why he introduced Edo-Madara into the storyline. But he confessed this was complicated at first. It ended up with confusion about the difference between the two characters.</p>
